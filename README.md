# 🚛 Quantum-Powered Multi-Route Optimization

A hybrid web-based system that leverages **classical algorithms** and **quantum computing** to optimize delivery routes across multiple destinations. This project demonstrates the use of **Dijkstra’s algorithm** and **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)** integrated with **Mapbox API** and **Flask** for efficient and interactive logistics planning.
